**Imperative Programming**:

- Describes how to perform tasks (step-by-step instructions).
- Examples: C, Java.

**Declarative Programming**:

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:

- Focuses on objects and data.
- Key Concepts:
  - **Encapsulation**: Hiding internal state.
  - **Abstraction**: Hiding complexity.
  - **Inheritance**: Inheriting properties from a parent class.
  - **Polymorphism**: Using the same interface for different data types.
