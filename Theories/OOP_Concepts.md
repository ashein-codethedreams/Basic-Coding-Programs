# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which contain both data and methods.

## 1. Class and Object

- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (instances).
- **Object**: An instance of a class.

Example:

```java
class Car {
    String model;
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving the car");
    }
}

Car myCar = new Car();
```
